# Contact Management System

This is a simple **Contact Management System** built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to manage and organize their contacts, including adding, updating, deleting, and viewing contact information. The application is designed to be easy to use and provides basic functionality to interact with the contact data.

## Features

- **Add a new contact**: Allows users to add a new contact with details like name, phone number, email, and address.
- **View contacts**: Displays a list of all stored contacts.
- **Update contact**: Allows users to update existing contact information.
- **Delete contact**: Users can delete contacts they no longer need.
- **RESTful API**: The application provides an API for interacting with the contacts, including routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting contacts.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript environment used for building the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and request handling.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing contact information.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Postman**: For testing API routes (optional, if you prefer to interact with the backend through API requests).
